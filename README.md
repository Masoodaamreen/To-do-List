# To-do-List

This Python script provides a simple command-line interface for managing a to-do list. Users can perform several operations: add new tasks, display all current tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The program prompts for user input to navigate through the options and offers continuous interaction for adding, marking, or deleting multiple tasks in one session. It's a handy tool for basic task organization.
